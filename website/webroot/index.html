				    <p>Introducing Cybertrike: A Global Journey for Change</p>
				    <p>
				    Cybertrike is a groundbreaking charitable project set to launch in April, embarking on an epic mission that transcends borders and will touch lives around the world…literally! Our primary aim is to raise awareness about obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) while advocating for low-cost, open-source CPAP machine solutions. By combining adventure and altruism, we're on a quest to create positive change on a global scale.<br> <br> </p>
				    <p>
				    In April, our pilot and the brains behind Cybertrike, Lee Hughes will set out on a world wide mission to bring sleep apnea to the attention of as many people as he can by cycling (on a digitally enhanced trike) across continents. The whole trip will be streamed online 24/7 with the aid of up to the minute tech, satellite links and help from each community we touch throughout the process. <br> <br> </p>
				    <p>
				    Lee was diagnosed with OSA in 2018 and fully understands the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for the condition. This is why he is now combining his passion with his condition to raise awareness and money for the cause. <br> <br>  </p>

				    <p>What we need, from anyone willing to help, is for them to: <br> <br> </p>

				    <p>  Spread the word! You can do this by joining the social media platforms, watching the live streams and sharing them to friends and family.
Donate where you can to either the go fund me or Patreon. This will help fund the journey and start a fund for CPAP machine access to people who would otherwise struggle to source a machine.
Buy some merchandise form the store!! Hats, T-Shirts, Hoodies, Mouse-mats, Posters….the list goes on and is growing. <br> <br></p>

Mission Aims:

<p>Raise Awareness: We're committed to shining a spotlight on the widespread but often misunderstood issue of obstructive sleep apnea. Our mission is to educate the world about the risks, symptoms, and importance of early diagnosis and treatment. <br> <br> </p>

Low-Cost Open-Source Solutions:

<p> Cybertrike will journey through diverse regions, and as we go, we'll be on a mission to promote the development and distribution of low-cost, open-source CPAP machine solutions. Our goal is to ensure that everyone, regardless of their circumstances, can access this life-transforming treatment. <br> <br></p>

Starting in April:

<p>In April, we'll set the wheels in motion for our long-distance trike ride. The journey will take us across various terrains, encountering diverse cultures, and forging connections with communities along the way. <br> <br> </p>

Route Around the World:

<p> Our route will be an epic adventure, spanning continents and encompassing remarkable landscapes. While specific details of the route are forthcoming, Cybertrike's path will take us through an incredible array of environments and communities as we circle the globe. <br> <br> </p>

<p>Stay tuned for updates, live streams, and immersive storytelling as we set out on this extraordinary voyage. Join us on this remarkable journey as we work together to make the world a better place through the Cybertrike project. Together, we can pedal for change, one kilometer at a time. <br> <br></p>
<p>The Cybertrike is equipped with several pieces of technology to help it achieve its mission of raising awareness of sleep apnea and providing CPAP machines to those in need. Here are some examples: <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Live streaming technology: The Cybertrike uses live streaming technology to allow viewers to follow the journey in real-time and interact with the rider. This technology allows the Cybertrike mission to reach a wider audience and engage with supporters from all over the world.</li>
                                        <li>Solar panels: The Cybertrike is equipped with solar panels to provide power to the electric motor and other onboard technology when camping off-grid. This sustainable technology helps to reduce the reliance on traditional sources of power and promote environmentally friendly travel.</li>
                                        <li>CPAP machines: The Cybertrike mission focuses on providing CPAP machines to those who cannot afford them. These machines use advanced technology to deliver continuous positive airway pressure and help those with sleep apnea to breathe more easily during sleep.</li>
                                        <li>Navigation technology: The Cybertrike uses navigation technology to plan and execute the route for the journey. This technology includes GPS navigation, maps, and other tools to help the rider stay on track and reach their destination safely.</li>
                                        <p>Overall, the Cybertrike uses a combination of advanced technology and sustainable practices to achieve its mission of raising awareness of sleep apnea and providing CPAP machines to those in need.</p>
